# Microservice-in-Rust
With microservice, I mean an application that speaks HTTP, accepts requests, speaks to a database, returns a response (possibly serving HTML), packaged up in a Docker container and ready to be dropped somewhere in the cloud.
## Why Rust ?
It has zero cost abstractions and **detailed** control over memory (like C++) but unlike C++ it has a borrow checker , which greatly improves memory safety hence no more **Segmentation Faults**.
